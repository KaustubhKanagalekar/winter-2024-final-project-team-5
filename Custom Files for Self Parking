These are the custom files that we created when making the parking recognition node.

Here are the steps that we took to make the node- 
1. `cd` to src, then `ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python selfparking --dependencies rclpy`
2. `touch launch.launch.py`
3. `chmod +x launch.launch.py` 
4. In `selfparking`, `cd selfparking` then `touch parking_recog.py`
5. `chmod +x parking_recog.py`
6. In the `src` directory, `colcon build --packages-select selfparking`
7. `source install/setup.bash`
8. `ros2 launch selfparking launch.launch.py`
